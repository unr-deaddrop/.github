[DeadDrop](https://unr-deaddrop.github.io/) is a command and control (C2) framework used in post-exploitation activities and penetration testing to create malware payloads, manage compromised devices, and generate operational reports. DeadDrop’s primary purpose is to aid legitimate security professionals (the “red team”) in an activity known as penetration testing, which assesses the company’s ability to defend against attacks and protect its data.

DeadDrop is a senior project for CS 426 (Spring 2024), instructed by David Feil-Seifer, Devrin Lee, and Sara Davis at the University of Nevada, Reno.

DeadDrop is developed by:
